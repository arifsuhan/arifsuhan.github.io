1. If your purpose is only learning programming: 
---------------------------------------------------
Way 1 - Hard to easy: 
      Learn C (for basic concept purpose), 
      then C++ (To know data structure), 
      Java (OOP - To learn Object oriented Programming),       
      Python( To play with data and Machine learning, automation) and so on.

Way 2 - Easy to hard: 
      Python, Java, C++, C.

3. When you want to be expert and get a specific profession:

a. Software Engineer - Problem solving (puzzle like)and programming language skill. Learn version control(Git + Github). Do PS(Problem solving) in various websites: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-10-most-popular-coding-challenge-websites-of-2016-fb8a5672d22f/. 
but I prefer hackerrank as it's beginner friendly. To get the taste of interview of top level company like amazon, google try: leetcode or hackerearth. 

Backend Dev -  Learn framework like django, flask, springboot, nodejs
Frontend Dev - Learn about Android, Kotlin, Flutter, Dart etc

b.DevOps - Start learning cloud computing (AWS, GCP), deployment tools (docker, jenkins etc),
c.Tester - software testing concepts and tools (postman - API testing, jmeter - performance testing, selenium, appium - automation, burp suite - security testing and so on) 

PS:
a. Check the job circular of companies and prepare yourself by learning those skills day by day.
b. Never stop learning. Subscribe to top youtuber, join programming community like JugBD and meet-attend the seminars.
c. Try to get international level skills instead of national or local.
d. Try to be in touch with a CSE student in BD better if you can make friendship with other country CSE fellow via social media. 

Finally best of luck
