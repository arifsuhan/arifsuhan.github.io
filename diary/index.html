            Can we call every human living in this planet a writer? The answer is easy - Yes, we all are. Now the question is how? Everyday from morning to night, some of we spent normal people's life and some don't. But one thing we have common we all get memory for future. Now-a-days people are so attached with virtual life that they don't feel the need of keeping a notebook or journal to write down about life's sweet memory. Just posting some selfies or status will not be able to fulfill the gap. Diary is raw peace and it always will be. So here is why I'm writing in a diary. This diary may contains some personal life memory or sometimes untold story.
